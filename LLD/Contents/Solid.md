## __S.O.L.I.D Principles__

### 1. __Single Responsibilty Principle__
```
It states that a class or a module should have only one reason to change, meaning that it should have only one responsibility or functionality. 
This principle makes the software easier to implement, maintain, test, and understand.

1. What is the single responsibility principle and why is it important?

2. How can you identify if a class or a module violates the single responsibility principle?

3. What are the benefits and drawbacks of applying the single responsibility principle to your code?

4. How can you refactor a class or a module that has multiple responsibilities into smaller and more cohesive units?

5. Can you give an example of a class or a module that follows the single responsibility principle in your previous or current project?

6. How do you test and document a class or a module that adheres to the single responsibility principle?

7. How do you balance the single responsibility principle with other design principles such as open-closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation, and dependency inversion?
